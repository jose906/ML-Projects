{"cells":[{"source":"## 1. Credit card applications\n<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature

In the case of predicting credit card applications, it is important to see if our machine learning model is equally capable of predicting approved and denied status, in line with the frequency of these labels in our original dataset. If our model is not performing well in this aspect, then it might end up approving the application that should have been approved. The confusion matrix helps us to view our model's performance from these aspects.  </p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"66"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"id":"b1962b3f-fb6f-4087-8bd5-202b3a5a43c9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\n# Use logreg to predict instances from the test set and store it\ny_pred = logreg.predict(rescaledX_test)\n\n# Get the accuracy score of logreg model and print it\nprint(\"Accuracy of logistic regression classifier: \", logreg.score(rescaledX_test,y_test))\n\n# Print the confusion matrix of the logreg model\nconfusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"66"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":36,"type":"stream"}},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":107,"lastExecutedAt":1699547830795,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\n# Use logreg to predict instances from the test set and store it\ny_pred = logreg.predict(rescaledX_test)\n\n# Get the accuracy score of logreg model and print it\nprint(\"Accuracy of logistic regression classifier: \", logreg.score(rescaledX_test,y_test))\n\n# Print the confusion matrix of the logreg model\nconfusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)"},"id":"e7f18d34-031a-4f6f-98e4-8372f1597d67","cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Accuracy of logistic regression classifier:  1.0\n"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"array([[204,   0],\n       [  0, 258]])"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"source":"## 11.
